# Resonance
A game made during a JAM (34 hours), with the main theme being "Echoes"

The project aims to blend a deep lore with an interactive and educational game. Our protagonist finds themselves on an island filled with numerous paranormal phenomena called Resonance Walls. These walls reflect echoes of a song written by our soulmate, attempting to guide us to escape and reunite with her. Our player is invited, upon hearing a note, to try and guess the chord being played on a piano. The stone reacts and ripples more strongly if the answer is close, and vice versa. If the correct note is found, our character can overcome the obstacle, and so on until we reach the end where our two soulmates meet again.

Developed with Unity over a period of 34 hours.
Created by four different people.

End credits: Taken from Chapter 9 of the game Celeste.
